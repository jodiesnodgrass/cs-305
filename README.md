Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artimus Financial is a banking company wishing to make a secure application that can be used world wide. The issue was creating the app for everyone and making sure it has correct security measures to prevent possible attacks. 

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

With vurlnerabilities the client was open to attacks. With added security measures and updates vilnerabilities were removed which made the app more secure. With a secure app clients could feel comfortable using Artemis leading to greater company bussiness with more customers. 

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I did not know that certificates could be crated and password protected. I tried creating a hash but it did not produce my name and hash number but it was a sucessful build. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

With each layer of security from input validation to APIs the app became more secure. In the future to decide what version hash to used I would check the most recent security version keeping it current to prevent any bugs or leaks. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I knew my code was functional by having a successful build. After adding the hash the code was more secure. I checked vulrenabilites with the dependency report. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I believe hashes would be a very helpful tool to encrypt data and prevent attacks that I may use in future tasks. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
